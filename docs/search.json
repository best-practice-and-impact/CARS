    "text": "The Coding in Analysis and Research Survey (CARS) data collection takes place for approximately one month, every autumn. The survey is self-selecting and participation is voluntary. Launch dates vary slightly by year to maximise response rate, for example by avoiding clashes with other internal surveys. In 2023, data collection took place from 16 October to 4 December.\nWe invite analysts to participate in the survey using a variety of online channels, mailing lists, networks and newsletters. For the past four years, the most common source of data has been through departmental Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) champions, who promote the survey in their organisations. We rely on various champion networks, Heads of Profession (HoPs) for analysis and Departmental Directors of Analysis (DDans) to promote the survey and encourage their analytical communities to participate. This means the response rate and any selection bias will vary across organisations.\nOur promotional materials make it clear that we are interested in responses from all analysts, whether or not they use coding in their work. The survey may however attract a disproportionate number of respondents who have an interest in coding and RAP. We advise against making strong inferences about differences between professions and departments or attempting to estimate real frequencies from the data because of these potential limitations.\nLastly, while the survey is open to all public sector analysts, the vast majority of responses come from the UK and devolved Civil Service (93.2% in 2023). As such, follow-up questions on grade and profession applied only to civil servants.\n\n\nLink tracking allows us to see where responses are coming from. Links promoted by RAP champions were the most commonly used for the past three waves, and accounted for over half of responses in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking link\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n\n\n\n\nRAP champions\n33.9%\n47.6%\n40.8%\n50.9%\n\n\nHoP/DDan mailing list\n4.7%\n12.8%\n15.7%\n20.2%\n\n\nOther\n12%\n2.6%\n6.8%\n11.9%\n\n\nProfession newsletters/mailing lists\n7.5%\n10.7%\n15.6%\n9.7%\n\n\nSlack\n12.2%\n3.7%\n11.8%\n7.3%\n\n\nQuality champions\n0%\n14.7%\n5.2%\n0%\n\n\nOther champions\n12.3%\n0.8%\n0%\n0%\n\n\nONS RAS mailing list\n17.5%\n7%\n4.2%\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nSample\n\n\n\n\n2020\n1060\n\n\n2021\n912\n\n\n2022\n1322\n\n\n2023\n1297"

Please contact the analysis standards and pipelines team for any enquiries about RAP or the champions network.\nThe Analysis Function RAP strategy was released in June 2022 and sets out plans for adopting RAP across government.\n\nKnowledge of RAP\nWe asked respondents who reported writing code at work, if they had heard of RAP.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n Show chart \n Show table \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nYes\n97.3%\n\n\nNo\n2.7%\n\n\n\n Sample size = 37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAP Champions\nWe asked respondents who had heard of RAP, if their department has a RAP champion and if they know who it is.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n Show chart \n Show table \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nYes, and I am a RAP Champion\n2.8%\n\n\nYes, and I know who the RAP Champion is\n44.4%\n\n\nYes, but I don't know who the RAP Champion is\n22.2%\n\n\nNo\n5.6%\n\n\nI don't know\n25%\n\n\n\n Sample size = 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwareness of RAP strategy\nWe asked respondents who had heard of RAP, if they had heard of the RAP strategy.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n Show chart \n Show table \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAP strategy knowledge\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nYes\n27.8%\n\n\nYes, but I haven't read it\n47.2%\n\n\nNo\n25%\n\n\n\n Sample size = 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinions on RAP\nWe asked respondents who had heard of RAP whether they agreed with a series of statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n Show chart \n Show table \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nStrongly Disagree (%)\nDisagree (%)\nNeutral (%)\nAgree (%)\nStrongly Agree (%)\n\n\n\n\nI and/or my team are currently implementing RAP\n19.4%\n19.4%\n16.7%\n19.4%\n25%\n\n\nI feel confident implementing RAP in my work\n8.3%\n16.7%\n22.2%\n25%\n27.8%\n\n\nI feel supported to implement RAP in my work\n11.1%\n8.3%\n11.1%\n38.9%\n30.6%\n\n\nI know where to find resources to help me implement RAP\n11.1%\n16.7%\n16.7%\n30.6%\n25%\n\n\nI or my team are planning on implementing RAP in the next 12 months\n5.6%\n11.1%\n27.8%\n22.2%\n33.3%\n\n\nI think it is important to implement RAP in my work\n2.8%\n8.3%\n2.8%\n30.6%\n55.6%\n\n\nI understand what the key components of the RAP methodology are\n13.9%\n5.6%\n16.7%\n44.4%\n19.4%\n\n\n\n Sample size = 36"

Please contact the analysis standards and pipelines team for any enquiries about RAP or the champions network.\nThe Analysis Function RAP strategy was released in June 2022 and sets out plans for adopting RAP across government.\n\nKnowledge of RAP\nWe asked respondents who reported writing code at work, if they had heard of RAP.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n Show chart \n Show table \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nYes\n94.7%\n\n\nNo\n5.3%\n\n\n\n Sample size = 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAP Champions\nWe asked respondents who had heard of RAP, if their department has a RAP champion and if they know who it is.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n Show chart \n Show table \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nYes, and I am a RAP Champion\n0%\n\n\nYes, and I know who the RAP Champion is\n27.8%\n\n\nYes, but I don't know who the RAP Champion is\n22.2%\n\n\nNo\n0%\n\n\nI don't know\n50%\n\n\n\n Sample size = 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwareness of RAP strategy\nWe asked respondents who had heard of RAP, if they had heard of the RAP strategy.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n Show chart \n Show table \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAP strategy knowledge\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nYes\n33.3%\n\n\nYes, but I haven't read it\n38.9%\n\n\nNo\n27.8%\n\n\n\n Sample size = 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinions on RAP\nWe asked respondents who had heard of RAP whether they agreed with a series of statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n Show chart \n Show table \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nStrongly Disagree (%)\nDisagree (%)\nNeutral (%)\nAgree (%)\nStrongly Agree (%)\n\n\n\n\nI and/or my team are currently implementing RAP\n22.2%\n22.2%\n22.2%\n22.2%\n11.1%\n\n\nI feel confident implementing RAP in my work\n5.6%\n16.7%\n33.3%\n27.8%\n16.7%\n\n\nI feel supported to implement RAP in my work\n5.6%\n11.1%\n27.8%\n44.4%\n11.1%\n\n\nI know where to find resources to help me implement RAP\n5.6%\n16.7%\n27.8%\n38.9%\n11.1%\n\n\nI or my team are planning on implementing RAP in the next 12 months\n11.1%\n22.2%\n16.7%\n33.3%\n16.7%\n\n\nI think it is important to implement RAP in my work\n0%\n5.6%\n11.1%\n66.7%\n16.7%\n\n\nI understand what the key components of the RAP methodology are\n5.6%\n16.7%\n11.1%\n50%\n16.7%\n\n\n\n Sample size = 18"

Only data from respondents in the Civil Service (CS) were included, and CS grades were collapsed into AO/EO, HEO/SEO (including Fast Stream) and G7/G6.\nThe results showed that analysts at HEO/SEO grade were more likely to code regularly compared to those in the grades above (G7/G6) or below (AO/EO) when controlling for profession and management responsibilities.\n63% of HEO/SEO analysts reported coding ‘regularly’ or ‘all of the time’ in their roles, compared to 54% of AO/EOs and 41% of G7/G6s. Coding frequency was increased in respondents who managed coders compared to those without management responsibilities, while those managing non-coders were the least likely of all groups to code frequently.\nOf the Civil Service professions, data scientists were more likely to code regularly compared to those not in the profession. Those in the economist (GES) and social research (GSR) professions were less likely to use code in their roles than other analysts.

Some analysts may have access to tools that others cannot access within the same organisation.\nThe most readily available tools were the open source tools, python (74%), R (92%) and SQL (69%), being available to the majority of respondents.

Despite it being widely available, only 37% were able to use python by comparison. Capability in each of the proprietary tools did not exceed 20%, suggesting that they are only used in particular roles.\nNote that capability in programming languages is self-reported here and was not objectively defined or tested.

Those at G7/G6 were less likely to have improved their coding skills in their role compared to lower grades. 21% of G7/G6 analysts felt their coding skills had declined while in role, which was higher than both HEO/SEOs (9%) and AO/EOs (4%). Management responsibilities and membership of a profession were not significantly associated with coding ability change.\nThis demonstrates the importance of regular practice in developing and maintaining coding capability, and suggests that analysts at higher grades face barriers to maintaining their technical skills."

However only 44% of respondents said that they were doing so, with 55% planning to implement RAP in the next 12 months. Discrepancies between support for and implementation of RAP by analysts suggests that there are barriers to implementation that still need to be overcome.\nThe responses were converted into a composite score after checking for consistency across the statements, and ANOVA was used to test if there was an effect of grade or profession membership on respondents’ opinions of RAP. Respondents who were members of a profession were generally more positive in their opinions of RAP, while grade had no effect. Professions can play an important role in promoting best practice such as RAP within analytical communities."

All other forms of documentation were used much less consistently suggesting that documentation is not being prioritised in analytical work. This has implications for reproducibility and long term sustainability of projects.\n\n\nSummary\nThe RAP strategy has three goals:\n\nto ensure analysts have the right tools to implement RAP principles\nto ensure analysts are supported to implement RAP principles\nto ensure there is a culture of RAP principles by default for analysis\n\nThe results from CARS 2023 indicate that public sector analysts are regularly using coding in their work and that open source tools are widely accessible. There is still progress to be made against the first goal however, particularly in ensuring Git is available to all public sector analysts. There also remains some discrepancy between availability and capability in different tools, meaning that even if open source tools are available they are not necessarily being used.\nOver half of respondents agreed that they felt supported implemented RAP principles and that they knew where to find resources to help. The data suggests that coding capability is increasing on the whole, however there are still some areas in which it is negatively affected. This is likely due to lack of opportunity to maintain coding skills in role, as coding frequency is strongly positively correlated with increasing capability. To maintain and improve the coding skills of analysts, it is important to allow time for active development as well as providing training resources.\nAlthough awareness of RAP appears to be increasing, there remains some inconsistency in the application of RAP principles. This suggests that coding best practice is not always applied by default. While this can be attributed to skills gaps in some instances, in others there may be specific project, role or departmental factors that mean RAP is being under-used."
