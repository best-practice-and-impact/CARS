    "text": "The Coding in Analysis and Research Survey (CARS) data collection takes place for approximately one month, every autumn. The survey is self-selecting and participation is voluntary. Launch dates vary slightly by year to maximise response rate, for example by avoiding clashes with other internal surveys. In 2024, data collection took place from 22 October to 31 December.\nWe invite analysts to participate in the survey using a variety of online channels, mailing lists, networks and newsletters. For the past four years, the most common source of data has been through departmental Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) champions, who promote the survey in their organisations. We rely on various champion networks, Heads of Profession (HoPs) for analysis and Departmental Directors of Analysis (DDans) to promote the survey and encourage their analytical communities to participate. This means the response rate and any selection bias will vary across organisations.\nOur promotional materials make it clear that we are interested in responses from all analysts, whether or not they use coding in their work. The survey may however attract a disproportionate number of respondents who have an interest in coding and RAP. We advise against making strong inferences about differences between professions and departments or attempting to estimate real frequencies from the data because of these potential limitations.\nLastly, while the survey is open to all public sector analysts, the vast majority of responses come from the UK and devolved Civil Service (90.5% in 2024). As such, follow-up questions on grade and profession applied only to civil servants.\n\n\nLink tracking allows us to see where responses are coming from. Links promoted by RAP champions were the most commonly used for the past three waves, and accounted for over half of responses in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking link\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n\n\n\n\nRAP Champions\n49.7%\n40.8%\n50.9%\n59.3%\n\n\nProfession newsletters/mailing lists\n21.5%\n31.2%\n29.9%\n31.3%\n\n\nOther\n9.6%\n11%\n11.9%\n6.1%\n\n\nSlack\n3.7%\n11.8%\n7.3%\n3.3%\n\n\nOther Champions\n15.5%\n5.2%\n0%\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nSample\n\n\n\n\n2021\n912\n\n\n2022\n1322\n\n\n2023\n1297\n\n\n2024\n1300"
