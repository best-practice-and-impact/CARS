<p>Given the same list of programming tools, all respondents were asked if they knew how to program with the tool to a level suitable for their work, answering “Yes”, “No” or “Not required for my work”.</p>
<p>Please note that capability in programming languages is self-reported here and was not objectively defined or tested. The statement “not required for my work” was similarly not defined.</p>

<p>Respondents with coding experience outside their current role were asked where they first learned to code. Those analysts who code in their current role but reported no other coding experience, are included as having learned ‘In current role’. Those who reported first learning to code outside of a work or educational environment were categorised as ‘self-taught’ based on free-text responses.</p>
<p>These data only show where people first learned to code. They do not show all the settings in which they had learned to code, to what extent, or how long ago.</p>

<p>We asked respondents who reported writing code at work how frequently they write different forms of documentation when programming in their current role.</p>
<p><a href="https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/code_documentation.html">Embedded documentation</a> is one of the components which make up a RAP minimum viable product. Documentation is important to help others be clear on how to use the product and what the code is intended to do.</p>

<p>We asked respondents about their knowledge of and opinions on <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/">reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP)</a>. RAP refers to the use of practices from software engineering to make analysis more reproducible. These practices build on the advantages of writing analysis as code by ensuring increased quality, trust, efficiency, business continuity and knowledge management.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions/">RAP champions</a> are a network of analysts across government who promote and support RAP development in their departments. Please <a href="mailto:asap@ons.gov.uk">contact the analysis standards and pipelines team</a> for any enquiries about RAP or the champions network.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/">Analysis Function RAP strategy</a> was released in June 2022 and sets out plans for adopting RAP across government.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rap-scores">RAP scores</h2>
<p>In this section we present RAP components and RAP scores.</p>
<p>For each RAP component a percent positive was calculated. Positive responses were recorded where an answer of “regularly” or “all the time” was given. For documentation, a positive response was recorded if both code comments and README files questions received positive responses. For the continuous integration and dependency management components, responses of “yes” were recorded as positive.</p>
<p>“Basic” components are the components which make up the <a href="https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/rap_mvp_maturity_guidance/blob/master/Reproducible-Analytical-Pipelines-MVP.md">RAP MVP</a>. “Advanced” components are components which help improve reproducibility, but are not considered part of the minimum standard.</p>
