<p>Given a list of programming tools, we asked respondents to answer “Yes”, “No” or “Don’t know” for the following questions;</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you know how to program with this tool to a level suitable for your work?<br>
</li>
<li>Is this tool available to use for your work?</li>
</ul>
<p>Access to tools does not necessarily refer to official policy. Some analysts may have access to tools others cannot access within the same organisation.</p>
<p>Please note that capability in programming languages is self-reported here and was not objectively defined or tested</p>

<p>We asked respondents about their knowledge of and opinions on <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/">reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP)</a>. RAP refers to the use of practices from software engineering to make analysis more reproducible. These practices build on the advantages of writing analysis as code by ensuring increased quality, trust, efficiency, business continuity and knowledge management. The <a href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions/">RAP champions</a> are a network of analysts across government who promote and support RAP development in their departments.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rap-scores">RAP scores</h2>
<p>In this section we present RAP components and RAP scores.</p>
<p>For each RAP component a percent positive was calculated. Positive responses were recorded where an answer of “regularly” or “all the time” was given. For documentation, a positive response was recorded if both code comments and README files questions received positive responses. For the continuous integration and dependency management components, responses of “yes” were recorded as positive.</p>
<p>RAP scores are then calculated for each respondent as the total of their positive responses. A score of 3 suggests that a respondent is implementing 3 components of RAP at least regularly.</p>
<p>“Basic components” are the components which make up the <a href="https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/rap_mvp_maturity_guidance/blob/master/Reproducible-Analytical-Pipelines-MVP.md">RAP MVP</a>. “Advanced components” are components which help improve reproducibility, but are not considered part of the minimum standard.</p>
