<p>Responding to CARS is voluntary. The results presented here are from a self-selecting sample of government analysts. We are unable to provide details about response rates by department or profession.

<p>Given a list of programming tools, we asked respondents to answer “Yes”, “No” or “Don’t know” for the following questions;</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this tool available to use for your work?<br>
</li>
<li>Do you know how to program with this tool to a level suitable for your work?</li>
</ul>
<p>Access to tools does not necessarily refer to official policy. Some analysts may have access to tools others cannot access within the same organisation.</p>
<p>Please note that capability in programming languages is self-reported here and was not objectively defined or tested</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rap-scores">RAP scores</h2>
<p>In this section we present RAP components and RAP scores.</p>
<p>For each RAP component a percent positive was calculated. Positive responses were recorded where an answer of “regularly” or “all the time” was given. For documentation, a positive response was recorded if both code comments and README files questions received positive responses. For the continuous integration and dependency management components, responses of “yes” were recorded as positive.</p>
<p>RAP scores are then calculated for each respondent as the total of their positive responses. A score of 3 suggests that a respondent is implementing 3 components of RAP at least regularly.</p>
<p>“Basic components” are the components which make up the <a href="https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/rap_mvp_maturity_guidance/blob/master/Reproducible-Analytical-Pipelines-MVP.md">RAP MVP</a>. “Advanced components” are components which help improve reproducibility, but are not considered part of the minimum standard.</p>
