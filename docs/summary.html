<p>Responding to CARS is voluntary. The results presented here are from a self-selecting sample of government analysts. We are unable to provide details about response rates by department or profession. Because respondents are self-selecting, the results we present reflect the views of the analysts who participated.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, most respondents reported coding regularly or all the time to complete work objectives. This may be in part due to respondent bias, where those with an interest in coding are more likely to respond to the survey. However, we can conclude that coding is now, and has been for at least a few years, a normal aspect of analysis work in the public sector for many analysts.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="access-to-and-knowledge-of-programming-languages">Access to and knowledge of programming languages</h3>
<p>Given a list of programming tools, we asked respondents to answer “Yes”, “No” or “Don’t know” for the following questions;</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you know how to program with this tool to a level suitable for your work?<br>
</li>
<li>Is this tool available to use for your work?</li>
</ul>
<p>Access to tools does not necessarily refer to official policy. Some analysts may have access to tools others cannot access within the same organisation.</p>
<p>Please note that capability in programming languages is self-reported here and was not objectively defined or tested</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="most-respondents-have-access-to-open-source-tools">Most respondents have access to open source tools</h4>
<p>More respondents reported having access to R and Python than any other programming language listed here. R, Python and SQL are the most accessible programming languages across government, ahead of well established licensed tools such as SPSS, SAS and Stata.</p>

<p>The proportion of respondents who report having the capability to use R and Python has been increasing over the past three waves of CARS. In contrast, the proportion who are able to use SAS, SPSS or Stata has been decreasing during this time. R and Python has risen dramatically in popularity in recent years due to their use in data science. Python in particular is now along the most used and <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/">most popular programming languages globally</a>, while both R and Python are in the top three most <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2022">popular programming languages for data science</a>.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="different-professions-have-capability-in-different-tools">Different professions have capability in different tools</h4>
<p>Differences in preferred languages may lead to silos between analytical professions. For digital and data professionals, operational researchers, data scientists and geographers capability is highest in R, SQL and python. R is among the two top languages for capability for every analytical profession.</p>
<p>However, proprietary tools tend to be more profession-specific. For example, economists have much higher stata capability than any other profession, while social researchers have the highest SPSS capability. Open source tooling offers better cross-profession as well as cross-department collaboration due to easier access to tools.</p>

<p>Access to git is generally high across government.

<p>Most respondents with prior coding experience reported that their coding capability has improved while in their current role. Again, this shows the Analysis Function is building capability in-house as well as recruiting analysts with existing capability. However, results also show a minority of respondents who feel they are losing their capability. As more analysts gain capability, it is important that existing skills are retained.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-often-people-write-code-is-a-strong-predictor-of-capability-change">How often people write code is a strong predictor of capability change</h3>
<p>Management responsibility and civil service grade are both negatively correlated with improvements to coding capability. In other words, more senior analysts are more likely to report that their coding abilities are becoming worse.</p>
<p>We used cross-government data to create an ordinal regression model. How often people write code was a very strong predictor at all levels (p &lt; 0.001) of whether respondents report improvement to their coding capability. Analysts who use code at work at least some of the time were 4.5 times more likely to report more improvement/less decline to their coding abilities than those who rarely or never wrote code at work. The effect was even greater for those who reported writing code regularly or all the time.</p>
<p>Civil service grade had a smaller effect, with those at grade 7 or 6 reporting less improvement to their coding abilities (p &lt; .001), but no significant difference between those at HEO and SEO grades (p &gt; .05). Line management responsibility and civil service grade had no significant effect when the model includes coding frequency regardless of whether it involved managing others who code (p &gt; .05).</p>
<p>These findings show that allowing analysts to continue coding is key to retaining and building on existing skills. While seniority is less predictive of capability change, it is correlated with how often people write code at work, meaning more senior analysts are more likely to lose their capability and less likely to build capability.</p>

<p><a href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions/">RAP champions</a> support and promote the use of RAP across government. Although most respondents who have heard of RAP had heard of the RAP champions’ network, most did not know who their RAP champions are. More work is needed to increase awareness of the support available across government, including who its RAP champions are.</p>

<p>We asked respondents who had heard of RAP a series of questions about their opinions on RAP. The majority agreed with the statement “I think it is important to implement RAP in my work” (71.4%), but only only 40% agreed they are currently implementing RAP.</p>
<p>Similarly , around half of the respondents agreed on various statements on understanding RAP and having the support and resources to implement it. While awareness and buy-in is high, this highlights the need to ensure analysts are aware of the resources currently available, and for additional resources to be made available where gaps currently exist.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="good-coding-practices">Good coding practices</h2>
<p>We asked respondents who reported writing code at work about the good practices they apply when writing code at work. These questions cover many of the coding practices recommended in the quality assurance of code for analysis and research guidance, as well as the <a href="rap_mvp_maturity_guidance/Reproducible-Analytical-Pipelines-MVP.md%20at%20master%20·%20best-practice-and-impact/rap_mvp_maturity_guidance%20·%20GitHub">minimum RAP standards</a> set by the cross-government <a href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions/">RAP champions network</a>.</p>
<section id="respondents-do-not-consistently-apply-rap-practices" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="respondents-do-not-consistently-apply-rap-practices">Respondents do not consistently apply RAP practices</h3>
<p>While many respondents make use of RAP practices, these are very inconsistently applied. The chart below present the frequency of respondents reporting that they apply these practices “regularly” or “all the time”. For documentation, writing readme files was considered a minimum requirement. For dependency management and continuous integration respondents were only asked whether they use these at all.</p>
<p>While most respondents who write code use open source software and peer review code regularly, this is not the case for other practices. Basic RAP practices, defined by the RAP champions network as being part of the <a href="rap_mvp_maturity_guidance/Reproducible-Analytical-Pipelines-MVP.md%20at%20master%20·%20best-practice-and-impact/rap_mvp_maturity_guidance%20·%20GitHub">minimum RAP standards</a> are presented in blue. Among these, open sourcing code is particularly uncommon, despite being part of the digital service standard.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The findings above show that the Analysis Function has made great strides towards RAP adoption. Using code for analysis is widespread. Open source coding tools such as R, Python, SQL and git are widely available and used (although this varies by organisation). RAP awareness has increased dramatically and many analysts feel supported to apply RAP in their work. Capability is generally increasing, but there is work to do to ensure analysts can retain these coding skills, especially as they move to more senior positions.</p>
<p>However, there is still much work to be done before RAP becomes the default way of working. While many analysts write code, few consistently apply RAP principles while doing so. Although most respondents see the value of RAP in their work and are actively implementing it, the data on good practices suggest that teams across the Analysis Function still have a work to do before consistently meeting the minimum RAP standards.</p>
